# The Compendium

This is the source code for the Compendium at [compendium.christoribio.com](https://compendium.christoribio.com)

I am really inspired by the Open Source community in the ways that they allow self-taught developers like me to craft the projects of their dreams.

So, this repository is available for anyone who finds it to see how I built the Compendium. Feel free to use anything that is in here and repurpose it for your own projects, or simply explore to your heart's content!

If you find anything that needs attention, or want to ask specific questions, feel free to reach out! You can shoot an email to [chris@thephilosophylab.com](mailto:chris@thephilosophylab.com) and I will get back to you as soon as I can!

Thanks for checking this out!
